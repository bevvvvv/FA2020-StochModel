# Chapter 1 Problem 4

Let $E, F, G$ be three events. Find expressions for the events.

## Part a

Only $F$ occurs:

\[E^c \cap F \cap G^c\]

## Part b

Both $E$ and $F$ but not $G$ occur:

\[(E \cup F) \cap G^c\]

## Part c

At least one event occurs:

\[E \cup F \cup G\]

## Part d

At least two events occur:

\[(E \cap F) \cup(E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G)\]

## Part e

All three events occur:

\[E \cap F \cap G\]

## Part f

None occurs:

\[(E \cup F \cup G)^c\]

## Part g

At most one occurs (Also the complement of at least two):

\[((E \cap F) \cup(E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G))^c\]

## Part h

At most two occur (Also the complement of all three):

\[(E \cap F \cap G)^c\]

# Chapter 1 Problem 11

If two fair dice are tossed, what is the probability that the sum is $i, i = 2, 3, ... 12$.

Recall the pmf of a single die. The likelihood of each digit is $p(x) = \frac16$. Since each digit has an equal likelihood of returning, we only have to count the total number of ways to sum to $i$ and then divide by the total number of combinations $6 * 6 = 36$ (size of sample space) to get the probability of the event to be that sum.

For example, for i = 7, we have 2 ways to get 1 and 6, 2 ways to get 2 and 5, and 2 ways to get 3 and 4. This would give i = 7 6 instances out of 36 total instances for a $p(i) = \frac16$.

| i | p(i) |
|---|------|
| 2 | $\frac{1}{36}$|
| 3 | $\frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18}$|
| 4 | $\frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$|
| 5 | $\frac{4}{36} = \frac19$|
| 6 | $\frac{5}{36}$|
| 7 | $\frac{6}{36} = \frac16$|
| 8 | $\frac{5}{36}$|
| 9 | $\frac{4}{36} = \frac19$|
|10 | $\frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}$|
|11 | $\frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18}$|
|12 | $\frac{1}{36}$|

We can see that the pmf outline above is valid, because all probabilities are between 0 and 1, and the sum of all probabilities is 1.


# Chapter 1 Problem 20

Three dice are thrown. What is the probability the same number appears on exactly two of the three dice?

To solve this we can look at a sub event: the probability of a one appearing on exactly two of the three dice.

There is exactly $\frac16$ ways for two of the dice to land on 1 and there is exactly $\frac56$ ways for the third die to land in order to not land on the same number. This gives us a probability of $\frac16*\frac16*\frac56 = \frac{5}{216}$ of exactly two to land on one. We can multiply the probabilities like this, because the events are independent.

Since this is the exact same case for each of the six digits we can multiply the value we found by 6, or add it together six times:

\[p(x) = 6*\frac{5}{216} = \frac{15}{108}\]

# Chapter 1 Problem 4

Let $E, F, G$ be three events. Find expressions for the events.

## Part a

Only $F$ occurs:

\[E^c \cap F \cap G^c\]

## Part b

Both $E$ and $F$ but not $G$ occur:

\[(E \cup F) \cap G^c\]

## Part c

At least one event occurs:

\[E \cup F \cup G\]

## Part d

At least two events occur:

\[(E \cap F) \cup(E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G)\]

## Part e

All three events occur:

\[E \cap F \cap G\]

## Part f

None occurs:

\[(E \cup F \cup G)^c\]

## Part g

At most one occurs (Also the complement of at least two):

\[((E \cap F) \cup(E \cap G) \cup (F \cap G))^c\]

## Part h

At most two occur (Also the complement of all three):

\[(E \cap F \cap G)^c\]
